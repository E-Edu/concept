# Technical Blog

## Articles

Articles are pages explaining what we did or what we currently do.

* [Redis Pub/Sub - How to scale internal service communication in the cloud](articles/redis-pub-sub.md)
* [Organization - What Teams do we have and what are they doing ?](articles/teams.md)

## Initiatives

Initiatives are pages explaining what we could do. Every developer can write initiatives and submit them to us using a merge request.

When a maintainer thinks the initiative is reasonable, it will be merged to the master where it stays until we decide to implement the things explained by the initiative.<br>
If we decide to use another initiative for the problem or the initiative is not implementable etc., it will be postponed or moved to the initiatives archive.
