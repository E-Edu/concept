## Concept for tasks

Subject -> LectureGroup -> Lecture -> TaskPack -> Tasks

Example:

- Math
  - Basic calculations
    - Addition
      - Tasks of MÃ¼ller (light)
        - 1+1=2
        - 9+1=10
      - Tasks of Dorothe (medium)
        - 32+32=64
        - 231+32=362
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
  - Geometry

## Report Reasons

- TROLLING
- FAULTY_TASK
- SPELLING_MISTAKE
- UNCLEAR
- INCORECTLY_CORRECTED
- DISCRIMINATING
- POLITICALY_INCORRECT
- BIASED
- OTHER

## Who takes care of the reports?

The principle should be like yodelling:
Once a user has successfully completed certain tasks in a LectureGroup, he or she will be invited for moderation.

When a task is reported, random mode gates in this area are presented with the task. 
They rate the task Annonymous and Democratic. If there is no definite result (in the range 40-60%) 
it is passed on to teachers or to admins.

Reported tasks are not available to the task pool for the time being

## Idea collection of task types

- Multiplechoice
- Word salad
- Freestyle
- Fullmatch --> Alternative solutions with 1/2 points
- Picture upload
- Simple Equasion
- complex equasion
- Connections --> Through API
- Sandbox code analysis
- Sheet music/MIDI
- MarkUp libraries for chemistry/bio/physics
- Translations --> Create bidirectional
- Drawing
